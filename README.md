# timer

This repository contains a simple program that implements a 5 second timer. The program is written in java. The goal of the project is to provide a basic example of how to create a 5-second countdown timer using code.

Operation
The program starts a counter at 5 seconds when it runs. While counting down, on-screen messages will appear to inform you of the seconds remaining. Once the 5 seconds have elapsed, the timer will stop and a final message will be displayed.
